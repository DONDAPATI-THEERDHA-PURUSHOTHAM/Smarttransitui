# Smarttransitui
SmartTransitUI is a smart web application that tells commuters how crowded a bus, metro, or station is right now and predicts how crowded it will be in the next 15–60 minutes. It helps people avoid packed vehicles and choose the best, safest, and least crowded route before starting their journey.
